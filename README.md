Before using the scripts, ensure you have the following:

- **Git** installed on your machine.
- **Node.js** installed for running JavaScript scripts (if applicable).
- An active **X** account.

## 🔑 Obtaining Required Tokens

To use certain scripts, you'll need specific tokens. Here's how to obtain them:

### 1. **Bearer Token**

The Bearer token is used for authenticating API requests.

- **How to Get It**:
  - Log in to your **X** account.
  - Navigate to the [Developer Portal](https://developer.twitter.com/) (assuming similar to Twitter).
  - Create a new application to obtain the Bearer token.
  - **Note**: If **X** does not have a developer portal, refer to their API documentation or contact support.

### 2. **Client ID and Client UUID**

These identifiers are necessary for certain API interactions.

- **How to Get It**:
  - **Client ID**:
    - Often provided when you register an application in the developer portal.
    - If unavailable, inspect network requests when using **X** to find the `client_id`.
  - **Client UUID**:
    - Can be extracted from network requests when interacting with **X**.
    - Use browser developer tools to monitor requests and locate the UUID.

> 🔒 **Security Note**: Keep your tokens confidential. **Do not** share them publicly or commit them to public repositories.
